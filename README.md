# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview and Purpose

The overall goal of this analysis was to utilize machine learning models and tools in order to predict credit risk. These predictions can help both banks and financial institutions gauge potential risk scenarios and recommend plans of attack or reaction to limit losses. While credit risk and trends are difficult to predict, these types of prediction tools are necessary to ensure that low vs. high risk customers are properly identified. More specifically, machine learning algorithm's give the user a higher degree of probablity thatany given predicition will be correct.

Summary

The ensemble classifiers were higher than the undersampled, oversampled, and combinations. Due to its balance of precision and recall results plus the high accuracy score, the Ensemble Sampling method is what should be used.
